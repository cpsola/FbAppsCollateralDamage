# FbAppsCollateralDamage

Simulates a social network friendship graph where users may or may not install an app, and analyses how many users have a friend with the App installed.

Parameters of the simulation:
	1. Number of nodes
	2. Expected_degree
    	3. Expected fraction of users with the app installed
	4. Graph_model (Barabási-Albért, Erdos-Renyi, or Watts-Strogatz)
	5. App adoption_model (uniform or prop_friends_installed)

For every configuration of parameters, the code: 
        1. Generates num_graphs graphs of n nodes with the given graph model and expected degree
        2. Assigns installations given adoption model and desired fraction of users
        3. Computes how many users have a friend with the app installed
